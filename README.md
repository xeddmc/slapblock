# SlapBlock
My Janky tkinter based gui attempt for cloning ethereum @ the last PoW commit and modifying basic parameters like genesis, consensus, difficulty, reward, logos, etc. Don't expect this to work well--that's why it's called slapblock--it's slapped together.

## Usage
- [ ] Use WSL or Linux, makes things easier.
- [ ] Install `Python3` and `GitPython`
- [ ] `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-full python3-git`
